## What we will cover

- What is an SLO?

## Notes

Service level objectives (SLO's) are a commitment that your software team makes to a certain measurement of performance.

Each service have certain numbers that the service cares about.
Common numbers to care about are:

- Latency
- Error rates
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Disk usage

However SLO's can be used to measure anything that your team cares about.

Each SLO's is made up of a number of Service level indicators (SLI's).
Each SLI is a measurement that is used to calculate the SLO.
